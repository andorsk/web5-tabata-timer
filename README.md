## Web5 Tabata Timer

Tabata timers are used for HIT excrcises. They give you short increments of
exercies and rest. I use it quite a bit, but the one I use has a paywall after 2
routines. This is a web5 based tabata timer.

What does web5 mean? Well, you'll own your data. Entirely. This means that you
don't need to worry about us looking at it ever. This was mostly a fun project
for myself, but I'll try to release it out the play store in the near future.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
